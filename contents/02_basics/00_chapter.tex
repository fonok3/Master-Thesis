\section{Erklärbarkeit}

Specifically, an explanation of a plan in this framework satisfies conditions (1) and (2) below: 1. An explanation is an update to the human mental model 2. such that there is no better plan in the updated mental model than the given plan. Clearly, from the perspective of the model of a planning problem, (1) can be in terms of one or more of • beliefs of the agent about the current state (as opposed to what the human may be aware of); • their actual desires or goals (as opposed to that ascribed to it by the human); • preconditions and effects of actions (as opposed to its capabilities known to the human). 3. Minimally Complete Explanation (MCE) is the shortest model explanation that satisfies (1) and (2). \cite{zahedi_towards_2019}

We consider an explanatory narrative as a sequence of information (explanans) to increase understanding over explainable data and processes (explanandum), for the satisfaction of a specified explainee that interacts with the explanandum having specified goals in a specified context of use. \cite{sovrano_modelling_2020}

Definition 3 (Explainability Requirement): A system S must be explainable for target group G in context C with respect to aspect Y of explanandum X. \cite{kohl_explainability_2019}
